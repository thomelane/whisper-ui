# Whisper

## Pre-requisites

* Docker
* Earthly

## Usage

```bash
earthly +run
# or equivalently
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 -v `pwd`/models:/app/models thomelane/whisper-ui:latest
```

## Development

```
earthly +dev-env
# Open VS Code with 'Rebuild and Reopen in Container'
```

ðŸ›‘ 'Rebuild' from VS Code doesn't rebuild the image, it just makes sure the *latest* image is being used.
Use `earthly +dev-env` to actually rebuild the container. Can even be called from inside the dev container!
